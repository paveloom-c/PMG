Abstract:
    We compile and analyze approximately 200 trigonometric parallaxes and
    proper motions of molecular masers associated with very young
    high-mass stars. Most of the measurements come from the BeSSeL Survey
    using the VLBA and the Japanese VERA project. These measurements
    strongly suggest that the Milky Way is a four-arm spiral, with some
    extra arm segments and spurs. Fitting log-periodic spirals to the
    locations of the masers, allowing for "kinks" in the spirals and using
    well-established arm tangencies in the fourth Galactic quadrant,
    allows us to significantly expand our view of the structure of the
    Milky Way. We present an updated model for its spiral structure and
    incorporate it into our previously published parallax-based
    distance-estimation program for sources associated with spiral arms.
    Modeling the three-dimensional space motions yields estimates of the
    distance to the Galactic center, R_0_=8.15{+/-}0.15kpc, the circular
    rotation speed at the Sun's position, {Theta}_0_=236{+/-}7km/s, and
    the nature of the rotation curve. Our data strongly constrain the full
    circular velocity of the Sun, {Theta}_0_+V{odot}=247{+/-}4km/s, and
    its angular velocity,
    ({Theta}_0_+V{odot})/R_0_=30.32{+/-}0.27km/s/kpc. Transforming the
    measured space motions to a Galactocentric frame which rotates with
    the Galaxy, we find non-circular velocity components typically
    <~10km/s. However, near the Galactic bar and in a portion of the
    Perseus arm we find significantly larger non-circular motions. Young
    high-mass stars within 7kpc of the Galactic center have a scale height
    of only 19pc, and thus are well suited to define the Galactic plane.
    We find that the orientation of the plane is consistent with the
    IAU-defined plane to within {+/-}0.1{deg}, and that the Sun is offset
    toward the north Galactic pole by Z{odot}=5.5{+/-}5.8pc. Accounting
    for this offset places the central supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, in
    the midplane of the Galaxy. The measured motions perpendicular to the
    plane of the Galaxy limit precession of the plane to <~4km/s at the
    radius of the Sun. Using our improved Galactic parameters, we predict
    the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar to be at a distance of
    6.54{+/-}0.24kpc, assuming its orbital decay from gravitational
    radiation follows general relativity.

Description:
    Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) arrays have been used to
    measure parallaxes and proper motions for about 200 maser sources
    associated with young massive stars. They include results from the
    National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Very Long Baseline Array
    (VLBA), the Japanese VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA)
    project, the European VLBI Network, and the Australian Long Baseline
    Array.

          have been adjusted upwards by sqrt(N), if not done so in the

          Motion components and their uncertainties are meant to reflect that
