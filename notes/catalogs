Notes:

1. Sakai et al. (2022PASJ...74..209S) state two options for the LSR velocity of G079.08+01.33:
   −18 ± 5 and −64 ± 1. Authors prefer the latter option due to consistency with other data
   (in particular, because the objects G073.65+00.19 and G075.29+01.32 have similar velocities
   in Reid et al. 2019)

2. In two papers of Sakai et al. (2021JPhCS2145a2011S and 2021ASPC..528..107S), there are different
   values of proper motions in galactic coordinates of H2O masers in the Sgr B2 region. The latter
   paper here is actually dated 2019.
