  abstract = {To construct the rotation curve of the Galaxy, classical Cepheids with proper motions, parallaxes and line-of-sight velocities from the Gaia DR2 Catalogue are used in large part. Our working sample formed from literature data contains about 800 Cepheids with estimates of their age. We determined that the linear rotation velocity of the Galaxy at the solar distance is V0 = 240~±~3~km s−1. In this case, the distance from the Sun to the axis of rotation of the Galaxy is found to be R0 = 8.27~±~0.10~kpc. A spectral analysis of radial and residual tangential velocities of Cepheids younger than 120~Myr showed close estimates of the parameters of the spiral density wave obtained from data both at the present time and in the past. Therefore, the value of the wavelength λR, θ is in the range [2.4–3.0] kpc, the pitch angle iR, θ is in the range [−13○, −10○] for a four-arm pattern model, and the amplitudes of the radial and tangential perturbations are fR ∼ 12~km s−1 and fθ ∼ 9~km s−1, respectively. Velocities of Cepheids older than 120~Myr currently give a wavelength λR, θ ∼ 5~kpc. This value differs significantly from the one we obtained from samples of young Cepheids. An analysis of the positions and velocities of old Cepheids, calculated by integrating their orbits backward in time, made it possible to determine significantly more reliable values of the parameters of the spiral density wave: wavelength λR, θ = 2.7~kpc and amplitudes of radial and tangential perturbations fR = 7.9~km s−1 and fθ = 5~km s−1, respectively.},

A global solution with all the relevant parameters solved for simultaneously is obtained, and a value for the projected distance (R) from the sun to the galactic center is determined from the kinematics. The discrepant values of R are examined which would be obtained if the standard methods of Feast and Shuttleworth (1965) and Trumpler and Weaver (1953) were applied to the velocity field of the preferred solution. It is found that the data are inconsistent with the hypothesis that the local compression of the velocity field indicated by proper motions and radial velocities is due to a global expansion of the Galaxy with expansion speed decreasing with increasing galactocentric distance. The results are shown to be consistent with the density-wave model.},

It is found that the cluster system is slightly flattened, and there is no evidence for any variation in flattening as a function of metallicity. A Hubble law describes its density as lying in the 0.2-5 solar radii range. A systematic difference in distance scale of about 0.5 magnitudes is needed to reconcile the centroid of this distribution with that of the metal-poor clusters, with the shift being of the same kind and size as that predicted by theoretical pulsation models of RR Lyrae stars. The effects of an estimated Galactic Center distance of 6.8 plus or - 0.8 kpc on an earlier dynamical analysis of the cluster system are considered, and judged to be small.},

The space coordinates of the clusters are calculated, and the distance information is applied to determine the true centroid of the cluster system as well as the distance to the galactic center. A value of 8.5 kpc is adopted for the latter, uncertainties in this determination are evaluated, and the total number of globular clusters in the Galaxy is estimated to be about 170. The space distribution of metallicity groups among the clusters is investigated along with the ellipticity of the cluster system, the three-dimensional density distribution in the system, and the relation between this distribution and metallicity. The relation of the outermost halo objects to the normal cluster system is briefly discussed, and a rough estimate of the total halo mass is obtained by assuming that the mass distribution of Population II halo stars is similar to the space distribution of the globular clusters.},

Our numerical simulations have been performed for the model segments representing the Perseus and Scutum arms based on masers in high-mass star forming regions. We show that the uncertainty in the present-day parallax measurements for these objects systematically decreases (!) with increasing heliocentric distance, while the relative uncertainty in the parallaxes is, on average, approximately constant. This lucky circumstance increases significantly (by a factor of 1.4–1.7) the accuracy of estimating R0 from the arm segment traced by masers. Our numerical experiments provide evidence for the consistency of the R0 estimate from the spiral-segment geometry. The significant biases of the estimate detected only for the Scutum arm are caused mainly by the random parallax errors, the small angular extent of the segment, and the small number of objects representing it. The dispersion of the R0 estimate depends most strongly on the angular extent of the segment and the parallax uncertainty if the latter, on average, does not depend on the distance. The remaining parameters, except for the pitch angle, exert an equally significant, but weaker influence on the statistical accuracy of the estimate. When the data on 3–8 segments are processed simultaneously, the predicted standard error of the final estimate is σR0 ≃ 0.5−0.3 kpc, respectively. The accuracy can be improved by increasing the extent of the identified segments and the number of objects belonging to them. The method of determining R0 from spiral segments has turned out to be operable for a wide set of possible parameters even when using an L-estimator (median). This makes the development of a more complex method based on an M-estimator, which allows one to properly take into account the measuring and natural dispersions of objects relative to the arm center line and, thus, to avoid the biases of the parameter estimates, meaningful.},

  abstract = {We are using the Very Long Baseline Array and the Japanese VLBI Exploration of Radio Astronomy project to measure trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of masers found in high-mass star-forming regions across the Milky Way. Early results from 18 sources locate several spiral arms. The Perseus spiral arm has a pitch angle of 16° ± 3°, which favors four rather than two spiral arms for the Galaxy. Combining positions, distances, proper motions, and radial velocities yields complete three-dimensional kinematic information. We find that star-forming regions on average are orbiting the Galaxy ≈15 km s-1 slower than expected for circular orbits. By fitting the measurements to a model of the Galaxy, we estimate the distance to the Galactic center R 0 = 8.4 ± 0.6 kpc and a circular rotation speed Θ0 = 254 ± 16 km s-1. The ratio Θ0/R 0 can be determined to higher accuracy than either parameter individually, and we find it to be 30.3 ± 0.9 km s-1 kpc-1, in good agreement with the angular rotation rate determined from the proper motion of Sgr A*. The data favor a rotation curve for the Galaxy that is nearly flat or slightly rising with Galactocentric distance. Kinematic distances are generally too large, sometimes by factors greater than 2; they can be brought into better agreement with the trigonometric parallaxes by increasing Θ0/R 0 from the IAU recommended value of 25.9 km s-1 kpc-1 to a value near 30 km s-1 kpc-1. We offer a "revised" prescription for calculating kinematic distances and their uncertainties, as well as a new approach for defining Galactic coordinates. Finally, our estimates of Θ0 and Θ0/R 0, when coupled with direct estimates of R 0, provide evidence that the rotation curve of the Milky Way is similar to that of the Andromeda galaxy, suggesting that the dark matter halos of these two dominant Local Group galaxy are comparably massive.},

These measurements provide strong evidence for the existence of spiral arms in the Milky Way, accurately locating many arm segments and yielding spiral pitch angles ranging from about 7° to 20°. The widths of spiral arms increase with distance from the Galactic center. Fitting axially symmetric models of the Milky Way with the three-dimensional position and velocity information and conservative priors for the solar and average source peculiar motions, we estimate the distance to the Galactic center, R 0, to be 8.34 ± 0.16 kpc, a circular rotation speed at the Sun, Θ0, to be 240 ± 8 km s-1, and a rotation curve that is nearly flat (i.e., a slope of -0.2 ± 0.4 km s-1 kpc-1) between Galactocentric radii of ≈5 and 16 kpc. Assuming a "universal" spiral galaxy form for the rotation curve, we estimate the thin disk scale length to be 2.44 ± 0.16 kpc. With this large data set, the parameters R 0 and Θ0 are no longer highly correlated and are relatively insensitive to different forms of the rotation curve. If one adopts a theoretically motivated prior that high-mass star forming regions are in nearly circular Galactic orbits, we estimate a global solar motion component in the direction of Galactic rotation, V ⊙ = 14.6 ± 5.0 km s-1. While Θ0 and V ⊙ are significantly correlated, the sum of these parameters is well constrained, Θ0 + V ⊙ = 255.2 ± 5.1 km s-1, as is the angular speed of the Sun in its orbit about the Galactic center, (Θ0 + V ⊙)/R 0 = 30.57 ± 0.43 km s-1 kpc-1. These parameters improve the accuracy of estimates of the accelerations of the Sun and the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar in their Galactic orbits, significantly reducing the uncertainty in tests of gravitational radiation predicted by general relativity.},

Our kinematic model comprises the overall rotation of the Galactic disk and the spiral density-wave effects, and the variation of radial velocity dispersion with Galactocentric distance. The best description of the observed velocity field is provided by the model with constant radial and vertical velocity dispersions, (σU0, σW0) ≈ (9.4 ± 0.9, 5.9 ± 0.8) kms−1. The resulting Galactic rotation curve proved to be flat over the Galactocentric distance interval from 3 to 15 kpc and we find the local circular rotation velocity to be V0 ≈ (235 − 238) ± 7 km s−1. We determine the parameters of the four-armed spiral pattern (pitch angle i ≈ −10. ◦ 4 ± 0.3◦ and the phase of the Sun χ0 ≈ 125◦ ± 10◦). The amplitudes of radial and tangential spiral perturbations are about fR ≈ −6.9 ± 1.4 km s−1, fΘ ≈ +2.8 ± 1.0 km s−1.

  abstract = {We compile and analyze approximately 200 trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of molecular masers associated with very young high-mass stars. Most of the measurements come from the BeSSeL Survey using the VLBA and the Japanese VERA project. These measurements strongly suggest that the Milky Way is a four-arm spiral, with some extra arm segments and spurs. Fitting log-periodic spirals to the locations of the masers, allowing for “kinks” in the spirals and using well-established arm tangencies in the fourth Galactic quadrant, allows us to significantly expand our view of the structure of the Milky Way. We present an updated model for its spiral structure and incorporate it into our previously published parallax-based distance-estimation program for sources associated with spiral arms. Modeling the three-dimensional space motions yields estimates of the distance to the Galactic center, \{R\}0=8.15+/- 0.15 \{kpc\}, the circular rotation speed at the Sun's position, \{\{\{\textbackslash Theta \}\}\}0=236+/- 7 km s-1, and the nature of the rotation curve. Our data strongly constrain the full circular velocity of the Sun, \{\{\{\textbackslash Theta \}\}\}0+\{V\}⊙ =247+/- 4 km s-1, and its angular velocity, (\{\{\{\textbackslash Theta \}\}\}0+\{V\}⊙ )/\{R\}0=30.32+/- 0.27 km s-1 kpc-1. Transforming the measured space motions to a Galactocentric frame which rotates with the Galaxy, we find non-circular velocity components typically ≲10 km s-1. However, near the Galactic bar and in a portion of the Perseus arm we find significantly larger non-circular motions. Young high-mass stars within 7 kpc of the Galactic center have a scale height of only 19 pc, and thus are well suited to define the Galactic plane. We find that the orientation of the plane is consistent with the IAU-defined plane to within ±0.°1, and that the Sun is offset toward the north Galactic pole by \{Z\}⊙ =5.5+/- 5.8 pc. Accounting for this offset places the central supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, in the midplane of the Galaxy. The measured motions perpendicular to the plane of the Galaxy limit precession of the plane to ≲4 km s-1 at the radius of the Sun. Using our improved Galactic parameters, we predict the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar to be at a distance of 6.54 ± 0.24 kpc, assuming its orbital decay from gravitational radiation follows general relativity.},

The effects of the orbit of the Sun around the Galactic center can account for this motion, and the residual proper motion of Sgr A* perpendicular to the plane of the Galaxy is -0.4+/-0.9 km s-1. A maximum likelihood analysis of the motion expected for a massive object within the observed Galactic center stellar cluster indicates that Sgr A* contains more than about 10\% of the \textasciitilde 4×106 Msolar deduced from stellar orbits. The intrinsic size of Sgr A*, as measured by several investigators, is less than 1 AU, and the implied mass density of \textasciitilde 1022 Msolar pc-3 is within about 3 orders of magnitude of a comparable supermassive black hole within its Schwarzschild radius. Our observations provide the first direct evidence that a compact radiative source at the center of a galaxy contains of order 106 Msolar and provides overwhelming evidence that it is in the form of a supermassive black hole. Finally, the existence of ``intermediate-mass'' black holes more massive than \textasciitilde 104 Msolar between roughly 103 and 105 AU from Sgr A* is excluded.},

  abstract = {Summary. The space distribution of globular clusters in our Galaxy is divided into three regions; a cone of avoidance around the rotation axis (COA), a faint cluster region, and a bright cluster region. The causes of such a division, especially of the COA, are studied. The orbits of test clusters are calculated over 2 1010 yr in the Schmidt (1965) mass model. Initially 63 test clusters are distributed in a sphere of radius 100 kpc and rotated with the angular velocity of a uniform sphere of radius 100 kpc with the mass and the angular momentum of our Galaxy. The tidal radius and, if possible, the increase in total energy by an impulsive approximation for a typical structure of globular clusters are calculated at each perigalactic passage to estimate the disruptive effect of the tidal field near the galactic center. It is found that clusters initially in the COA reappear there only for 14\% of the total time and, as a result, the density in the COA is considerably rarefied compared to that outside the COA, and that most of them are disrupted by the tidal force of the galactic center. The other clusters cannot enter the COA and clusters with large tidal radius always stay in the bright cluster region. The three division of galactic space is therefore interpreted by the instability of an orbit with low angular momentum and the tidal disruptive effect. The apparent frequency distribution of angular momenta of surviving test clusters derived on the assumption that they have no tangential motion with respect to the Sun shows a peak around zero, though their real distribution does not show such a peak. We make a new estimate of the distance to the galactic center Ro=9.2+l.3 (m.e.) kpc in such a way as to maximize the size of the COA. Key words: globular clusters - cone of avoidance - distance to the galactic center},

The accuracy in the VERA astrometry is revisited and compared with that from the other VLBI astrometry projects such as BeSSeL (The Bar and Spiral Structure Legacy) Survey and GOBELINS (the Gould's Belt Distances Survey) with the VLBA (Very Long Baseline Array). We have confirmed that most of the astrometry results are consistent with each other, and the largest error sources are due to source structure of the maser features and their rapid variation, along with the systematic calibration errors and different analysis methods. Combined with the BeSSeL results, we estimate the up-to-date fundamental Galactic parameters of \$R\_\{0\}=7.92\textbackslash pm 0.16\_\{\textbackslash rm \{stat.\}\}\textbackslash pm 0.3\_\{\textbackslash rm \{sys.\}\}\textbackslash :\$ kpc and \$\textbackslash Omega \_\{\textbackslash odot \}=30.17\textbackslash pm 0.27\_\{\textbackslash rm \{stat.\}\}\textbackslash pm 0.3\_\{\textbackslash rm \{sys.\}\}\textbackslash :\$ km \$\textbackslash :\$ s \$\^\{-1\}\textbackslash :\$ kpc \$\^\{-1\}\$ , where \$R\_\{0\}\$ and \$\textbackslash Omega \_\{\textbackslash odot \}\$ are the distance from the Sun to the Galactic center and the Sun's angular velocity of the Galactic circular rotation, respectively.},

  abstract = {The distribution of globular clusters is studied. Individual distances are redetermined on the basis of available data and an adopted apparent magnitude of +0.6 for RR Lyrae stars. Both metal-poor (H) and comparatively metal-rich (D) clusters appear to have an essentially spherical distribution with the D clusters concentrated close to the galactic center except for a few cases. Kinematic data are consistent with the spatial density distributions if a circular-velocity value for the local standard of rest of 200 to 225 km/s is adopted (for a solar distance from the galactic center of 9 kpc). The mass density in the globular-cluster system declines sharply beyond 20 kpc from the center. Estimates of the mass of the halo are made. While it is quite possible that the mass of the halo exceeds that of the disk, there is no evidence that the mass of the galaxy exceeds previous estimates by a substantial amount.},
